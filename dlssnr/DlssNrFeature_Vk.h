// DLSS 5 Neural Rendering on Vulkan, natively.
//
// The model ships a complete Vulkan surface -- fourteen exported entry points against D3D12's ten,
// including both extension requirement queries -- so a Vulkan game has no need of the D3D12 bridge
// this pass reached it through before. What stopped it was never the model; it was the device. NGX
// loads its kernels through two NVIDIA vendor extensions no game enables, and a Vulkan device's
// extension list is fixed at creation, so asking afterwards gets a permanent no. OptiScaler already
// appends them in its vkCreateDevice hook, and Enshrouded confirmed the device is created with them.
//
// What differs from the D3D12 path, and why:
//
//   * The game's colour, depth and motion arrive already wrapped. NGX hands Vulkan resources over as
//     NVSDK_NGX_Resource_VK, so only this pass's own images need wrapping.
//   * Layouts are explicit. There is no equivalent of a D3D12 resource state promotion, so every
//     image is moved to the layout each dispatch needs and moved back.
//   * There is no root signature to save and restore, so no envelope. The bindless hazard that cost
//     007 First Light a device on D3D12 has no Vulkan counterpart.
//
// The composition shader is shared, compiled from the same source to SPIR-V. Any behavioural
// difference between the two backends is a bug rather than a design.
