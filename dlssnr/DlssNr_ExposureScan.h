// Looking for the exposure the game computed but never handed over.
//
// The problem this exists for: a game whose exposure moves with the lighting, and which does not
// pass an exposure texture to the upscaler. Spider-Man and Kingdom Come 2 are both this. The white
// point is then a constant divisor against a moving exposure, and the picture drifts or flickers as
// the scene's lighting changes -- which is not a value the user chose badly, it is one number being
// asked to be two things.
//
// The observation this is built on: those games still COMPUTE an exposure. Essentially every engine
// with eye adaptation writes one into a tiny texture or buffer every frame, reads its own previous
// value to smooth it, and uses it downstream. It simply never reaches the upscaler. So the number is
// not something to reconstruct from pixels -- it is sitting in memory, unread.
//
// Which matters because every attempt to reconstruct it from pixels has failed, twice, for the same
// reason each time. Anything measured off a frame is a statement about that frame's content, and the
// finished frame is downstream of bloom, depth of field, the interface and our own edit. The game's
// own number is upstream of all of it.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
//
// It does not decide anything. It watches, and it reports what it found, and that is deliberate: the
// last two times a number was inferred here it went straight into the interface as a suggestion and
// was wrong -- 8 where 240 was right, and confidently offered on a black screen. So this ships as an
// instrument. Whether a found value is worth consuming is a question for after the readout has been
// looked at in real games, not a question this answers.
//
// A found buffer also carries no contract. NVIDIA's exposure texture is defined by the SDK as "the
// final exposure scale"; a buffer we discovered ourselves might hold a multiplier, a divisor, or a
// stop value in log space, and nothing in it says which. That is why the eventual use is a RATIO
// against the value at the moment the user set their white point, where the units cancel -- not an
// absolute number.
